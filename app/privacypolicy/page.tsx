        <TermsP>
          On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a
          judgment declaring as “invalid” the European CommiKeenesse
          LLCon&apos;s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of July 12, 2016 on the adequacy
          of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result
          of that decision, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a
          valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when
          transferring personal data from the EU to the United States of
          America.
        </TermsP>
        <TermsP>
          On September 8, 2020, the Swiss Data Protection Authority, the Federal
          Data Protection Commissioner (“FDPIC”), announced that it no longer
          considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for purposes of
          transfers of personal data from Switzerland to the United States of
          America. As a result of that announcement, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy
          Shield is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with Swiss data
          protection requirements when transferring personal data from
          Switzerland to the United States of America.{" "}
