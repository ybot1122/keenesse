          YOU AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES ARISING FROM OR
          RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THESE TERMS, YOUR USE OF
          THE SERVICE, OR YOUR AND OUR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER SHALL BE
          FINALLY SETTLED AND RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AS
          DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IS INTENDED TO
          BE INTERPRETED BROADLY. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE
          COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR
          CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION
          (“AAA”), AS MODIFIED BY THIS SECTION. THE ARBITRATION WILL BE
          CONDUCTED BY JUDICIAL ARBITER GROUP, INC. (“JAG”) USING ONE ARBITRATOR
          WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING COMMERCIAL CONTRACT DISPUTES,
          WHO SHALL BE SELECTED FROM THE APPROPRIATE LIST OF JAG ARBITRATORS IN
          ACCORDANCE WITH THE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES OF JAG. IF JAG IS
          UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ARBITRATE A DISPUTE, THEN THE DISPUTE MAY BE
          REFERRED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION ORGANIZATION OR ARBITRATOR THAT YOU
          AND WE AGREE UPON IN WRITING OR THAT IS APPOINTED PURSUANT TO SECTION
          5 OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. FOR ANY CLAIM WHERE THE TOTAL AMOUNT
          OF THE AWARD SOUGHT IS $10,000 OR LESS, THE ARBITRATOR, YOU AND WE
          MUST ABIDE BY THE FOLLOWING RULES: (A) THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE
          CONDUCTED SOLELY BASED ON TELEPHONE OR ONLINE APPEARANCES AND/OR
          WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS; AND (B) THE ARBITRATION SHALL NOT INVOLVE ANY
          PERSONAL APPEARANCE BY THE PARTIES OR WITNESSES UNLESS OTHERWISE
          MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES. IF THE CLAIM EXCEEDS $10,000, THE
          RIGHT TO A HEARING WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE AAA RULES, AND THE
          HEARING (IF ANY) MUST TAKE PLACE IN LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. THE
          ARBITRATOR&apos;S RULING IS BINDING AND MAY BE ENTERED AS A JUDGMENT
          IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, OR APPLICATION MAY BE MADE TO
          SUCH COURT FOR JUDICIAL ACCEPTANCE OF ANY AWARD AND AN ORDER OF
          ENFORCEMENT, AS THE CASE MAY BE.
        </TermsP>
        <TermsP>
          THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE
          SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT AND REVIEW BY
          A COURT IS LIMITED. NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A COURT OR
          JURY TRIAL OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION. YOU
          UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE THROUGH
          INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, YOU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A COURT OR
          JURY TRIAL. ANY DISPUTE SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS,
          AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION OR
          ANY SIMILAR PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE THE CLAIMS
          OF MULTIPLE PARTIES.

          ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
          IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, ANY
          PRODUCTS, OR YOUR AND OUR DEALINGS WITH ONE ANOTHER MUST BE COMMENCED
          IN ARBITRATION WITHIN TWO (2) YEARS AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
          AFTER THAT TWO (2)-YEAR PERIOD, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS
          PERMANENTLY BARRED. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW TIME LIMITATIONS
          OTHER THAN THOSE SET FORTH IN SUCH STATE&apos;S STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
          LAWS. IN SUCH CASES, THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS PROVIDED
          FOR UNDER THE LAWS OF UCH STATE SHALL APPLY.

          YOU AGREE THAT ALL CHALLENGES TO THE VALIDITY AND APPLICABILITY OF THE
          ARBITRATION PROVISION—I.E. WHETHER A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR DISPUTE IS
          SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION—SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE ARBITRATOR.
          NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION IN THESE TERMS TO THE CONTRARY, IF THE

          THAT YOU SHALL NOT SEEK TO, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO, ARBITRATE CLASS OR
          COLLECTIVE CLAIMS. IF THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS SECTION IS
          FOUND UNENFORCEABLE OR TO NOT APPLY FOR A GIVEN DISPUTE, THEN THE
          PROCEEDING MUST BE BROUGHT EXCLUSIVELY IN THE STATE COURTS OF
          COMPETENT JURISDICTION LOCATED IN KING COUNTY WASHINGTON, AS
          APPROPRIATE, AND YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT TO THE PERSONAL JURISDICTION OF
          EACH OF THESE COURTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF LITIGATING SUCH CLAIMS OR
          DISPUTES, AND YOU STILL WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, WAIVE YOUR
          RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PROCEED IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION, AND
          REMAIN BOUND BY ANY AND ALL LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY AND DAMAGES
          INCLUDED IN THESE TERMS. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE
          TERMINATION OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US.
          THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT INVOLVES INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND,
          THEREFORE, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C.
